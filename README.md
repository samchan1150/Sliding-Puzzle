# Introduction

The Sliding Puzzle Game is a classic brain teaser that challenges you to arrange numbered tiles in their correct order by sliding them around a grid. It's a fun and engaging way to test your logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## How to Play

### Objective
Arrange the tiles in ascending numerical order, starting from 1 up to the highest number, with the empty space positioned in the bottom-right corner of the grid.

### Game Setup
- **Select Grid Size**: Choose a grid size between 3x3 and 5x5. This determines the difficulty levelâ€”the larger the grid, the more challenging the puzzle.
- **Shuffled Tiles**: The game presents you with a grid containing shuffled numbered tiles and one empty space.

### Sliding Tiles
- **Move Tiles**: You can move a tile into the empty space if it is adjacent to it (either horizontally or vertically).
- **How to Move**: Click or tap on a tile next to the empty space to slide it into that space.
- **Strategize**: Plan your moves to shift tiles into their correct positions.

### Game Progression
- **Rearrange Tiles**: Continue sliding tiles one at a time, working towards arranging all the numbers in order.
- **Track Your Performance**: The game keeps count of your moves and the time elapsed since you started.

### Winning the Game
- **Completion**: You've solved the puzzle when all tiles are in numerical order, and the empty space is in the bottom-right corner.
- **Celebrate**: Upon completion, the game may display your total moves and time taken, allowing you to challenge yourself to improve.

## Tips for Success

- **Think Ahead**: Visualize the sequence of moves needed to position a tile correctly.
- **Start with Corners and Edges**: Focus on completing rows or columns starting from the top-left corner.
- **Be Patient**: Some configurations require moving tiles temporarily out of place to achieve the desired arrangement.
- **Practice**: The more you play, the better you'll understand the patterns and strategies involved.
